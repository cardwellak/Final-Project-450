Intro/Question   
The Columbia River and its tributaries host some of the largest salmon and steelhead runs   
* Most donâ€™t make it back to the river to spawn  
* Today, depending on the run 1/10 of 1 percent to 2 percent of smolts return as salmon  
* 1 to 2 percent higher survival rate would result in a doubling of current Columbia population  
* Historically, excessive damming has had the most lasting impact on salmon population     
     * Today, and in the future, salmon and steelhead also battle effects of global warming  
* We know high water temperatures kill salmon   
     * Want to explore the data that supports this fact  

Question: How does temperature affect the health of an annual Columbia River salmon/steelhead return?  

Data  
* Temperature data is from the United States Geological Survery (USGS)   
     * Location: Bonneville Dam Forebay  
     * Annual temperature average for months April-August  
          * This is the time period when majority of fish are counted  
          * Incomplete data in winter months 
     * Obtain data: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=453845121562000   
* Fish counts are courtesy of the fish passage center at the Bonneville Dam  
     * Run by the Corps of Engineers
