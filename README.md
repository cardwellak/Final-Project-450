Intro/Question   
The Columbia River and its tributaries host some of the largest salmon and steelhead runs   
but most donâ€™t make it back to the river to spawn  
* Depending on the run 1/10 of 1 percent to 2 percent of smolts return as salmon  
* Salmon spend most of their lives in cold ocean water
    * Want to explore effect of warm rivers in the early and late portion of their lives


Question: How does water temperature affect the health of an annual Columbia River salmon/steelhead return?  

Data  
* Temperature data is from the United States Geological Survery (USGS)   
     * Location: Bonneville Dam Forebay  
     * Annual temperature average for months April-August  
          * This is the time period when majority of fish are counted  
          * Incomplete data in winter months 
     * Obtain data: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=453845121562000
        * Choose sampling frequency, temperature (or any characteristic of interest), date range, format
* Fish counts are courtesy of the fish passage center at the Bonneville Dam  
     * Run by the Corps of Engineers  
     * Obtain data: http://www.fpc.org/web/apps/adultsalmon/Q_adultcounts_annualtotalsquery.php
        * Select sampling site (BON for Bonneville dam), start and end date, and species
